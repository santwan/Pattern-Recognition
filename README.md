# ðŸ“Š Pattern Recognition

This repository contains notes, visualizations, and Python implementations related to **Pattern Recognition** â€” a key topic in Machine Learning and AI. It covers theoretical concepts along with practical code to help understand classification, decision boundaries, and probability density functions.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- ðŸ”¸ Handwritten theory notes (PDFs/images)
- ðŸ”¸ Python code for class-conditional probability plots
- ðŸ”¸ Visual decision boundaries & classifiers
- ðŸ”¸ Future: Bayesian classifiers, k-NN, feature selection

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- Matplotlib & SciPy for plotting
- NumPy for calculations

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repo and run Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pattern-recognition.git
